# Volusion-Blog-Page-Javascript
This is the Javascript function used for reversing the order of the blog html elements
It will find all html elements with the class blog-card, then create a a variable of total based on how many elements were found, and from there it will assign each element a css order property based on the total variable minus its current index (which index starts at 0). As an example, if the total variable is 9 blog cards, the third blog-card element in the index (which since starting at 0 would mean it would have an index of 2) would be assigned an order of 7 because it would be 9 - 2

This way it essentially reverses the display order of the html elements so merchants do not have to worry about adding new blog cards to the top of the html card elements, but can more easily just add it below the last entry, and the last one will show up first as it will be the "latest entry". The pain point this solves is ease of use.

12-30-25 update: On initial implmentation of this as external js file rather than used directly in script tag, noticed the browser painted the html elements in an unreversed order for a split milisecond before js ran. This would be more apparent on an actual MX's site where their images will not all be the same place holder and would be more noticable to a user. To compensate for this, I changed the blog list container to have a visibility of hidden until the js function runs, once the js finishes reversing the order it sets the visibility to from hidden to visible. So the cards are hidden for that brief milisecond before they are rerversed.
